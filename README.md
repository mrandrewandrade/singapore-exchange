##money matters
exchange rate

banks

taxes

credit cards
cost tabulation
I personally have an international bank card which allows me to do international transactions with
no exchange free so I went to any ATM and withdraw money when I wanted.
With the student you have a couple of free banking options. Bring $100-$200 Singaporean dollars
for the first couple of days. Once you get your student ID card you can open the student account
    and deposit money into the account. I personally recommend DBS since they offer a large number
    of ATM's around the country. You can exchange money in little India or other locations which offer
    the best exchange rate.

##Housing
- Very expensive
- generally go to residence (very affortable)
- craiglist, local sites for cash

food and drink

## travel
- in singapore


- around singapore



Visas:
Singapore offers a great number of surrounding countries and opportunities for amazing travel
experiences. Visas are required for some countries and not required for others. At the time of this
writing, Canadian citizens do not require visas for Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the
Philippines. Visa's are required for countries like Myanmar, China, Vietnam and many others. Visa
applications are different for each country, please consult the websites of the countries for the
updated information. Lucky for you, Singapore is a central hub of travel and offers many
embassy's for you to get the required visas.
Note on E-Visas: Most countries offer an electronic visa process. In Myanmar there is the official
government website, but for other countries such as Vietnam, there are many non-official sites
which offer visa applications. The way the process works is you provide your personal information
and they send you a letter of approval which you show customs, pay a stamping fee and get your
visa.
Myanmar: visa on arrival → apply online and pa the fee, wait to be approved. The other cheaper
option is to visit the embasy which involves half a day
China: Visit the embassy in Singpaore and how proof of hotels and flights
Vietnam: Visa arrival (pay is US dollars)
Important note: The US dollar is the standard for payement. Bring CLEAN, CRISP and NEW bills
since in certain countries (such as myanmar) they on accept PERFECT bills.
